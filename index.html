                <p>
                    I, am a young curious mind, who aspires to explore his interests within the Web Development scene.
                    My best quality traits can be described as kind, respectful and a person who keeps to themselves.
                    Technology has fascinated me to a point where I became the top Computer Applications Technology learner for the entirety of my senior high school career.
                    Through practical assignments of developing websites, I gained the core components of Web Development.
                    Though, competing in miniature hackathons with friends has laid the foundation of my programming skills.
                    As technology advances so must I, thus constant self-improvement has become a priority to me.
                    A fantastic way to improve on the skills I have would be to venture in the Full Stack Web Development.
                    Given that this department consists of both front-end and back-end development, my talents and limits will be pushed to its very limits.
